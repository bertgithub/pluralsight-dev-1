SOLID Principles:
1. Single Responsibility principle(SRP)
  A class should only have a single responsibility.
2.Open-Closed Principle(OCP)
  Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution principle(LSP)
  Object should be replaced with instances of their subtype without altering program correctness.
4. Interface segregation principle
  Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface
5. Dependencies Inversion Principle
  Dependencies should be abstract rather than concrete.
